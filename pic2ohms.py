# TODO: showcase localizer and goniometer
# load the best localizer and goniometer
# load an image 
# make a b/w version
# use  localizer to find resistors
# pass the subimages to goniometer to read the angles
# get the subimages from the color picture
# rotate the subimages back to 0ยบ and output them.

# TODO: implement the reader and use it to tag the subimages
